                    <p>Former StrikeForce champions Ronaldo "Jacare" Souza and Gegard Mousasi rematch in the main event. In their
                        first fight, in Japan's DREAM in 2008, Mousasi won via upkick. Jacare has gone 11-1 with one NC since
                        then, including four straight wins in the UFC. Mousasi has gone 12-2-1 in the same period, most recently
                        dropping a unanimous decision to Lyoto Machida, and then crushing Mark Munoz in the first.</p>
                    <p>Former Strikeforce heavyweight champion Alistair Overeem fights Ben Rothwell in the co-main. Though the
                        massive Dutchman impressed in his debut, he has since disappointed. Looking to get his name back into title
                        contention, the "Demolition Man" will need to avoid mental errors AND look like the killer we thought he once
                        was. Rothwell has managed to alternate wins and losses thus far in his Octagon. He'll look to break that
                        streak on Friday.</p>
                    <p>Main Card (Fox Sports 1, 10 p.m. ET)<br>
                        Ronaldo "Jacare" Souza (185) vs. Gegard Mousasi (186)<br>
                        Alistair Overeem (248) vs. Ben Rothwell (264)<br>
                        Matt Mitrione (255) vs. Derrick Lewis (264)<br>

                <div id="story2"><h3>Pettis vs Melendez</h3>
                    <p>Gilbert Melendez laughs off the fact that his next opponent, UFC lightweight champion Anthony Pettis, is
                        going to be featured on a Wheaties box and he won't. "I shop at Whole Foods anyway," Melendez quipped to reporters
                        Thursday.But Melendez stopped joking around at the The Ultimate Fighter 20 media day when it came to the heat
                        between Pettis and Melendez's Skrap Pack running mate, Nate Diaz.</p>
                    <p>In the leadup to TUF's 20th season, Pettis has seemed more concerned with Diaz than Melendez, his opposing coach
                        on the show and title challenger on Dec. 6. "I definitely want to kick his ass," Pettis said last week of Diaz,
                        who was Melendez's TUF 20 assistant coach. "I was on the show with him every day, I was there seven weeks and he
                        didn't say anything."</p>
                    <p>For his part, Melendez says he's not sure why Pettis seems fixated on someone he isn't scheduled to fight. "I don't
                        even know why he keeps bringing Nate up," Melendez said. "He had six weeks to say something to Nate too, and he
                        didn't, so I don't know what he was talking about. It's like when a girl is all â€˜she didn't say hi to me.'Well,
                        did you say hi to her? That's just garbage."</p>
