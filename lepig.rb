<h2>A Whole Lot of Randomness</h2>
<p>There isn't a lot to say about a whole lot of randomness, only that I like weird pictures that don't make much sense. Take this <a id="cage" href="http://i.imgur.com/DGg4jX1.jpg"> photo</a> of Nicolas Cage's head on Andre the Giants Body. Nothing againts Sir Andre, but I can't sand Nick Cage, so this is just too much for me.  <a href="http://middleeasy.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10419:wanderlei-silva-left-a-path-of-carnage-blood-and-violence-against-brian-stann-at-ufc-on-fuel-tv&catid=34:organizations"> here</a>. <!--<a href="www.mmafighting.com"> this creates a link when using-->

<h1>What I did this week</h1>
<p>Last week I started watching the greatness that it LOST. I'm in a critical phase in my watching of the series. If I can stay interested and continue watching. It has nothing to do with Lost becoming less watchable, it's more to do with me keeping Lost a priority. I'm starting to get into Black Ops 2 and I can see it begining to consume a lot of my time. We'll see mr. polar bear, we'll see.</p>
