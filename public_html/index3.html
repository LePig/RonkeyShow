<h2><strong></strong>News</strong></h2>
<p>After one of the biggest most successful UFC events ever, another huge fight week is upon us. Starting with
    UFC Fight Night 26, then UFC 166 Henderson vs Pettis. With so much UFC in one month, I can hardly keep up.
    One thing is certain, Contenders will rise and fall, legends will be made, and fighters will say dumb things.

<h1>What I did this week</h1>
<p>Last week I started watching the greatness that it LOST. I'm in a critical phase in my watching of the series. If I can stay interested and continue watching. It has nothing to do with Lost becoming less watchable, it's more to do with me keeping Lost a priority. I'm starting to get into Black Ops 2 and I can see it begining to consume a lot of my time. We'll see mr. polar bear, we'll see.</p>
